# Title

Forever Pet Adoption

# Project description

<p> In this project, we want to create a pet adoption application. This application will present the user with an option to search a dog breed they're interested in. The breed the user searches if (available) will produce a list of the shelters with the breed available to adopt, a picture of the animal available, and IDK a name maybe. There are two APIs we're interested in using. The first which will allow the user to search dog breeds; and the second which will, in turn (if available) return the results mentioned prior.

</p>

# User Story

<li>I want to be able to simply search animal breed I am interested in, </li>

</ul>
