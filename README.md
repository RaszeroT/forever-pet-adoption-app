# Title:

Dog Breed Encyclopedia -- NOTE-- This can be re-thunk

## Project description:

<p> In this project, we want to make a simple application that can help you search for a book about you favorite dog breeds and make it as easy as "select and search." Using third party APIs the User will be presented with a list of dog breeds. THEN upon clicking submit, the User will be presented with a list of books about that breed. The User will be presented with an image of said book, the title, and a short description. The User will then have the ability (if applicable) to click a link to be directed to the website to purchase.

## What we learnt as a team in this project:

<p>As a team in this project, it is easy to say that we learned multiple. First, working with others on a single project proves more difficult than first expected. We have honed our skills in using GitHub with multiple contributors, creating issues, and using Kanban.<br>However, having the opportunity to work with others shows that many eyes looking at one issue can be a speedy resolve to a daunting problem.<br> We have also learned, it is important to have a daily scrum before any work is done so everybody can have there own tasks and be able to check in with you're team mates. <br> Next, we have worked together to debug issues to end up with the MVP for product as a first task, but to do so, we had to work together with debugging and honing dot notation to be pulling the correct data.<br>Not only do we believe we learnt much during this project but we also understand that we have a lot to learn. But, <i>Thats the exciting part<i></p>
